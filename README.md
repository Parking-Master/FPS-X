# FPS-X
FPS-X will be an open source version of [FPS](https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS) based on [version 3](https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS3). It will be the highest-performing game in the series with simple yet amazing functions to build whatever you want with it.

Development on FPS-X has begun on __June 10th 2024__, and is not expected to be released until late October or mid November.

### ❗ Update: Development progress tracker
This tracker shows the current progress of this project.

About 25 weeks left of development.

- 4/6 Rifles have been added so far.
- New zooming capabilities have been added, where the game is programmed to zoom into the 3d gun, instead of display a fake scope image like FPS3.

### ❗ Update: Almost there!
If you don't know already, actual focused development on FPS-X will begin _June 10th_. Next week, development starts!

If you've been following these updates, you probably know that we've progressively been working on a prototype of what the game will sort-of be like. It is going to be an ultra-performant game fit for many more devices than with the previous FPS games. It will also feature plenty of misc content and game modes. In the mean time, we've also been discovering bugs from all three previous games and finding numerous ways to fix all of them. The beta version is located [here](https://parking-master.github.io/FPS-X/beta-1.0.0).

Can't wait? Neither can we! We want to make the greatest FPS game in the world, and better yet, make it free + available to play right in your browser. This game doesn't have an official release date yet, but the release date will be revealed sometime in July or August. The game should be done and available by October or November though. It's annoying that it won't be released for quite a while, but just remember, quality takes time.

### ❗ Update: Beta 1.0.0 released!
Today (4/17/24) we released the first ever prototype version of FPS-X. Some users report that it runs pretty smoothly on Macbook Pros, iPad Pros, and some iMacs. It also has a touch screen UI that was imported from the last game (FPS3), but the controls have been updated a little.

If you'd like to try it out, no worries! Here is the URL to the prototype:

https://parking-master.github.io/FPS-X/beta-1.0.0

Make sure your device/browser can run WebGL and it has good performance because FPS-X uses a lot of resources to function.

### ❗ Update: Plans to begin creating FPS-X
The official start date of building this game will begin June 10th, 2024. We have a working prototype of this game with a nice and simple UI that we plan on using in the real game. We will also be adding the following to this game:

- First Person Shooter battles
- Aircraft battles
- Tank battles

On top of that, The _FPS battles_ (the classic FPS-style game) will also include ground vehicles and maybe helicopters.

As for the game's performance, we've done lots of research on [Three.js](https://threejs.org) on how to get the best performance in this game possible. No more lags, glitches, players losing connection, etc.

### Update: Fair game for all players
We've just implemented a new script into the prototype of the game, which sets the game UI and screen to a native 16:10 aspect ratio, then scales the screen down on various sized monitors.

We have tried building something similar for FPS3, but failed. This script actually achieves the goal of what we wanted: a fair game for all players. All players will now have a screen that is a 16:10 ratio.

### Update: Multiplayer functions, graphics, and performance are doing good so far
Using [Gametime.js-X](https://x.gametime.js.org), we've been able to get awesome results so far with the multiplayer functions. It can hold up  to 8 players as we know of, and unlike the previous FPS games, it is not just a 1v1 game and can hold multiple players at once.

As for the graphics and performance, we've found a website called [hdri-haven.com](https://hdri-haven.com) where we can use 8k panoramic domes as the sky. As a result, it looks a lot more realistic, and doesn't take up any more performance.

### Update: Approximate "release date" revealed
We will begin creating an official version of this game starting June 2024. We plan on building this game until October/November 2024, right around the holidays. Please check back soon for more information.

### Update: New prototype
Parking Master has been working on a prototype since August 2023. Based on the performance, features, and UI, we may transform this into the actual FPS-X soon.
