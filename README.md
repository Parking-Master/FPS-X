# FPS-X
FPS-X is an open source version of FPS based on version 3. It is the highest-performing game in the series with simple yet amazing functions to build whatever you want with it.

Actual developement on this exciting project will not begin until __early/mid 2024__.

### Update: New prototype
Parking Master has been working on a prototype since August 2023. Based on the performance, features, and UI, we may transform this into the actual FPS-X soon.
