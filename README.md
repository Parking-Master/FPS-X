# FPS-X
FPS-X will be an open source version of [FPS](https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS) based on [version 3](https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS3). It will be the highest-performing game in the series with simple yet amazing functions to build whatever you want with it.

Actual developement on this exciting project will not begin until __June 2024__.


### ‚ùó Update: Plans to begin creating FPS-X
The official start date of building this game will begin June 10th, 2024. We have a working prototype of this game with a nice and simple UI that we plan on using in the real game. We will also be adding the following to this game:

- First Person Shooter battles
- Aircraft battles
- Tank battles

On top of that, The _FPS battles_ (the classic FPS-style game) will also include ground vehicles and maybe helicopters.

As for the game's performance, we've done lots of research on [Three.js](https://threejs.org) on how to get the best performance in this game possible. No more lags, glitches, players losing connection, etc.

### Update: Approximate "release date" revealed
We will begin creating an official version of this game starting June 2024. We plan on building this game until October/November 2024, right around the holidays. Please check back soon for more information.

### Update: New prototype
Parking Master has been working on a prototype since August 2023. Based on the performance, features, and UI, we may transform this into the actual FPS-X soon.
