# Welcome to FPS X
FPS X is an online multiplayer shooter game developed by [Parking Master](https://github.com/Parking-Master). It was released on December 31st, 2024.

It is the fourth game in the series so far, following FPS, FPS2, and FPS3. FPS X was based on FPS3, but entirely remade for highly improved performance, better graphics, and ease of use. The game contains 23 weapons, 5 multiplayer maps, 3 different game modes, and 3 characters to choose from. The game also includes a way to run a local socket server on your network for lower latency or as a LAN game. Up to 4 players can play a single match.

FPS X is now available to play at [fpsx.parkingmaster.tk](https://fpsx.parkingmaster.tk).

# Improvements
This game is fully compatible with most newer iPad models, most Macbooks and iMacs, most Android tablet and smartphone models, and even some newer iPhones. It is available to play via Mouse/Keyboard, Touch Screen controls, and Gamepad controls. Unlike the previous games, FPS X now has options to fully change Key and Controller bindings.

Some major improvements from the previous games are in terms of performance. The game can run at nearly a 5 times faster framerate than FPS3, 3 times faster framerate than FPS2, and a 6 times faster framerate than FPS1. One major reason for improved performance in FPS X is due to reduction of [memory leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak). In previous games, memory leaks led to a huge amount of lag, freezing, and battery drainage over time. Not only does FPS X have faster framerate, but it now has the ability to maintain this high framerate over the course of an entire game, leading to better user experience and playability.

The game also contains significantly more weapons than all of the previous games, with a whopping 23 available guns. FPS3 had the most weapons, with only 13 available weapons (12 guns, 1 knife). This is the only game to have custom animations for each weapon, whereas in previous games, most weapons just used a single animation for everything (firing, reloading, walking, and idling).

Lastly, the menu design is entirely different from all of the previous games. It follows the "simplicity" rule, but in a more artistic approach. For example, instead of the blank solid background (or gradient background like FPS2), we changed this to a customizable esthetic wallpaper. Next, we added better spacing rules, instead of just centering everything at once and having all of the menu controls right in your face, we organized different sections of the menu via tabs. The menu consists of four tabs: Play, Options, Stats, and your Account.

- __Play__: shows everything you need to set and start a game.
- __Options__: gives you full customization of in-game settings like your loadout and key bindings.
- __Stats__: instead of a shop, we added a stats page. This shows you all of your game stats like total points and games played.
- __Account__: This tab is interchangable to "Log in" as well, but primarily focuses on your profile customization, logging in, or registering.

The image below shows the main menu (with the default wallpaper).

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/007db4dd-a528-4851-8b06-5e11571c6850">
</details>

Finally, we added a touch of "estheticness" by not immediately centering all features of the menu to the center. Instead, we aligned them to the bottom left, keeping ease of use throughout the entire menu, while making it look nicer.

The fonts used on the menu are: Open Sans, Thunderbolt, and Arial.
The fonts used in-game are: Filson Pro, and Thunderbolt.

The menu also has better speeds when navigating it, because all content is loading inline when the main menu is loading. The menu no longer redirects you to other pages. Instead, all content is loaded directly when doing things like switching tabs or changing settings. This allows for better user experience as well.

### Running a LAN sever
Running a LAN (Local Area Network) server is beneficial for lower-latency games, especially if you're playing with friends and are already on the same network. By default, you are using a [Gametime.js X Public Socket Server](https://github.com/Parking-Master/Gametime.js-X#connecting-to-a-server) for multiplayer. But we are going to cover how you can easily host your own local Socket Server.

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you already have these installed:
- Node.js
- NPM
- Socket.io
- Git

1. Download the [Socket Server File](https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS-X/blob/main/socket.js) for FPS X
2. Find the path to the file you downloaded, then run:
   - `$ node /path/to/file.js`
   - This will start the socket server on your machine.
3. In order to connect your socket server to FPS X, you need to find either your machine's IP address or Hostname. How you find it will vary between Mac, Windows, and Linux. You can also just use [localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).
4. Download FPS X onto your system using either `git`, or by downloading from the source:
   - `$ git clone https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS-X`
   - Or download manually from [here](https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS-X/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
5. With FPS X now installed, go to the downloaded folder, and edit the files `index.html` and `src.html`.
6. Find the lines that start with `gametime.setCustomServer`. Then, as one of the server URLs, add the hostname or IP address of your socket server into the server list.
7. Save the file, then run `$ node server.js` in the FPS X directory.
8. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and you will see the FPS X main menu. [Start a game](#starting-a-game) and it will attempt to find a game through your local network.

Also feel free to edit the code yourself after you download FPS X. You can add custom mods, cheats, or even change the graphics!
